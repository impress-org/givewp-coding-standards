# GiveWP Coding Standards

This repository is the mastor record for the GiveWP coding standards. When using another GiveWP
repository, its standardization files should match these. If they do not, they should be updated.

If you have any standardization questions or suggestions, please create an Issue or Pull Request
in this repository. Changes can be applied otherwise.

## PHP Standards

We use PSR-12. For ease of use with PhpStorm, just zip up the contents of the phpstorm directory
and do File > Manage IDE Settings > Import Settings. Don't worry, it won't override themes or
stuff like that, just inspections and code standards.

## JS Standards

For JS, please refer to the Prettier file.

## Everything Else

For all other files, the .editorconfig file addresses those.

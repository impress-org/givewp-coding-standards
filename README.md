# GiveWP Coding Standards

This repository is the mastor record for the GiveWP coding standards. When using another GiveWP
repository, its standardization files should match these. If they do not, they should be updated.

If you have any standardization questions or suggestions, please create an Issue or Pull Request
in this repository. Changes can be applied otherwise.

For PHP, we stick as close to the PSR-12 standard as possible.

For JS, please refer to the Prettier file.

For all other files, the .editorconfig file addresses those.
